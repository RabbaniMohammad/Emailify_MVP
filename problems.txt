now working on the admin button when clicked the number is showing but the pending only getting shown when refresh manually and also deactivate is not working when deactivate and refreshed the user still able to access the application


note this is AI please check before continuing
button checking as well not only the link checking
adding more no of previews not only mobile display 
adding info to template that should contain all the info

back and front page navigation it should have to be seamless no refresh because its angular

- Why don't scientists trust atoms? Because they make up everything!

it should be more deterministic

{"error":"connect ETIMEDOUT 89.192.9.178:27017"} (any error it should show a custom error)

currently we are fixing these 
1. I have asked for a back and forth arrows because there many pages out there. If you need the files of those pages I will it to you 
2. no need to show super admin the navbar just show the photo and name and the arrow on the button should not turn when hovered but should turn down when clicked 
3. No need to show duplicate information when clicked on the button just show logout for now thats it 
4. make the navbar responsive and remove the templates button and add left and right arrows for seamless navigation 
5. those arrows should be to the left of the photo and name




right now R 
the logout design is not that good 
the front arrow is not working but the back arrow is working
