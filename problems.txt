should not have to be hold the animation


note this is AI please check before continuing
button checking as well not only the link checking
adding more no of previews not only mobile display 
adding info to template that should contain all the info

back and front page navigation it should have to be seamless no refresh because its angular

Ideas:
- Why don't scientists trust atoms? Because they make up everything!

it should be more deterministic

{"error":"connect ETIMEDOUT 89.192.9.178:27017"} (any error it should show a custom error)






right now R 
the logout design is not that good 
the front arrow is not working but the back arrow is working

instead of preview we have to put the technology is in early stages and could make mistakes


we also need to change the component on the template page with template preview it is redundant

also need to move the template preview cache ts to the new component preview folder



preview animation is not working for other templates
refresh is not working it is taking time (refresh is sending it back to the backend I think it is kind of a good thing)

run button showing even before preview

when we are in last page we are moving to first page directly
