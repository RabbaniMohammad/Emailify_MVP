    <h1>Messaging & Opt-In Policy</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last updated: November 25, 2025</p>

    <p>
      This Messaging & Opt-In Policy explains how <strong>TSQS INC</strong>
      (“we”, “us”, “our”) expects its clients (“Clients”) to collect, store, and use
      consent when sending campaigns through <strong>Camply</strong>.
      Our platform supports messaging via SMS (Twilio), WhatsApp and Instagram Direct Messages (Meta),
      and email (via integrated email providers).
    </p>

    <p>
      By uploading contacts or sending campaigns using our platform, you agree to follow
      this policy and all applicable laws and carrier guidelines (including but not limited to
      TCPA, CTIA, CAN-SPAM, GDPR, CCPA, and Meta & Twilio messaging policies).
    </p>

    <h2>1. Permission-Based Messaging Only</h2>
    <p>
      Our platform is intended for permission-based communications. You may only message individuals
      who have given <strong>explicit, informed consent</strong> to receive messages from your organization
      through the channels you use (SMS, WhatsApp, Instagram Direct Messages, and/or email).
    </p>

    <h2>2. Acceptable Forms of Opt-In</h2>
    <p>
      Consent must be obtained directly by you (the Client) and must clearly disclose:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Who is sending the messages (your brand or organization name), and</li>
      <li>What type of messages they will receive (e.g., offers, alerts, updates), and</li>
      <li>Which channels you will use (SMS, WhatsApp, Instagram DM, email), and</li>
      <li>How often you may contact them, and how they can opt out.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Examples of valid opt-in methods include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Online signup forms with a clear consent statement and checkbox.</li>
      <li>Checkout or registration forms where subscribers explicitly agree to receive marketing messages.</li>
      <li>In-person or paper forms that clearly state the above and are stored as records.</li>
      <li>Double opt-in flows (e.g., “click to confirm” email or “reply YES to confirm” SMS).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Opt-in must never be hidden in terms & conditions or pre-checked boxes. The subscriber must
      take a clear, affirmative action to consent.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Channel-Specific Consent</h2>
    <p>
      You must have consent appropriate for each messaging channel. A subscriber may choose to
      receive messages on some channels and not others.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong class="channel">SMS (Text Messaging)</strong> – You must obtain express consent to send
        SMS messages to the subscriber’s phone number. CTIA and carrier rules apply.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong class="channel">WhatsApp</strong> – You must obtain explicit opt-in to receive messages
        on WhatsApp for your brand, following Meta’s commerce and messaging policies.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong class="channel">Instagram Direct Messages</strong> – You may only send messages to users
        who have initiated conversation with you or who have opted in through a clearly disclosed form.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong class="channel">Email</strong> – You must have permission to email the subscriber and comply
        with CAN-SPAM and other applicable regulations.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Our platform stores channel-level consent flags (SMS, WhatsApp, Instagram DM, email) and may block
      sending where consent has not been recorded.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Prohibited Practices</h2>
    <p>You may <strong>not</strong> use our platform to send messages to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Purchased, rented, or scraped contact lists.</li>
      <li>Individuals who have not explicitly agreed to receive your messages.</li>
      <li>Individuals who have previously unsubscribed or opted out.</li>
      <li>Contacts collected for one purpose but used for unrelated marketing without additional consent.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      We reserve the right to suspend or terminate messaging access if we detect high complaint rates,
      spam-like behavior, or other violations of this policy.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Proof of Consent & Record-Keeping</h2>
    <p>
      When you upload contacts to <strong>Camply</strong>, you will be asked to confirm
      that all contacts in the CSV have explicitly opted in for the channels you intend to use. You may
      upload proof of consent (e.g., screenshots, form URLs, process descriptions), which we store securely
      for compliance purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
      You are responsible for maintaining your own records of consent (e.g., form submissions, logs,
      timestamps). If carriers, providers (such as Twilio or Meta), or regulators request evidence of
      opt-in, it is your responsibility to provide it.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Opt-Out and Unsubscribe</h2>
    <p>
      You must provide clear and simple ways for recipients to stop receiving messages and honor those
      requests promptly.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>SMS:</strong> support standard keywords such as “STOP” to unsubscribe.</li>
      <li><strong>WhatsApp / Instagram:</strong> respect user messages requesting to stop, blocks, or other clear opt-out actions.</li>
      <li><strong>Email:</strong> include a visible unsubscribe link in each marketing email.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Once a subscriber has opted out on any channel, you must not send further messages on that channel
      through our platform.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Data Privacy & Security</h2>
    <p>
      We process contact data on your behalf as a service provider / processor. We implement reasonable
      technical and organizational measures to protect contact data stored in our systems. For more
      details, please review our <a href="https://www.tsqsinc.com/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Client Responsibilities</h2>
    <p>As our Client, you agree that you will:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Collect, store, and manage consent in compliance with all applicable laws.</li>
      <li>Provide accurate information when confirming opt-in and uploading proof.</li>
      <li>Only send messages that are consistent with what subscribers were told at the time of opt-in.</li>
      <li>Promptly update opt-out preferences in your systems.</li>
      <li>Cooperate with any reasonable compliance review or audit.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>9. Our Role</h2>
    <p>
      We provide tools to capture, store, and enforce consent settings, but we do not act as your legal
      advisor and we do not independently verify every proof of opt-in you upload. You remain fully
      responsible for your own compliance practices and for ensuring that your use of our platform is lawful.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Messaging & Opt-In Policy from time to time. When we do, we will revise the
      “Last updated” date at the top of this page. Your continued use of the platform after any changes
      constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
    </p>
