# üîß Visual Editor - Image Upload & Drag-Drop Fix

## Problems Fixed

### ‚ùå Problem #1: Add Image Button Not Working
When clicking the "Add Image" button in the visual editor, the file manager/asset picker was not opening. Additionally, clicking the "Drop files here or click to upload" area didn't open the file picker.

**Root Cause:** 
1. GrapesJS `assetManager` was not configured in the initialization options
2. With `upload: false`, GrapesJS doesn't create a file input element
3. The "click to upload" area was not hooked up to trigger a file picker

---

### ‚ùå Problem #2: Drag & Drop Not Working for ESP/AI Templates
When loading templates from ESP or AI-generated sources, components were not draggable or selectable. However, templates built from scratch in the visual editor worked fine.

**Root Cause:** ESP and AI-generated templates come with complex HTML structures and inline styles. When GrapesJS loads them, it doesn't automatically make all components interactive (draggable, selectable, editable). Templates built from scratch use GrapesJS components which have these properties by default.

## Solutions Implemented

### ‚úÖ Fix #1: Configure Asset Manager + Custom Upload Handler

**Part A: Added Asset Manager Configuration**

```typescript
assetManager: {
  assets: [],
  upload: false,           // No server upload needed
  uploadName: 'files',
  multiUpload: true,
  embedAsBase64: true,     // ‚úÖ Embed images as base64
  openAssetsOnDrop: true,  // Auto-open on drag-drop
  autoAdd: true,           // Auto-add dropped assets
},
```

**Part B: Added Custom File Picker Functionality**

Created `setupAssetManagerUpload()` method that:
1. Waits for Asset Manager to render in the DOM
2. Finds the upload area (`.gjs-am-file-uploader`)
3. Creates a hidden file input element
4. Hooks up click event to trigger file picker
5. Reads selected files as base64
6. Adds them to the Asset Manager

```typescript
private setupAssetManagerUpload(): void {
  setTimeout(() => {
    const uploadArea = document.querySelector('.gjs-am-file-uploader');
    
    // Create hidden file input
    const fileInput = document.createElement('input');
    fileInput.type = 'file';
    fileInput.accept = 'image/*';
    fileInput.multiple = true;
    
    // Handle file selection
    fileInput.addEventListener('change', (e) => {
      const files = e.target.files;
      const am = this.editor.AssetManager;
      
      Array.from(files).forEach((file) => {
        const reader = new FileReader();
        reader.onload = (event) => {
          am.add({
            src: event.target.result, // base64 data
            name: file.name,
            type: 'image'
          });
        };
        reader.readAsDataURL(file);
      });
    });
    
    // Make upload area clickable
    uploadArea.addEventListener('click', () => {
      fileInput.click(); // Open file picker
    });
  }, 500);
}
```

**What This Does:**
- Enables the Asset Manager functionality
- Allows users to click "Add Image" button ‚Üí Opens asset picker modal
- Users can add image URLs manually in the input field
- **Users can click "Drop files here or click to upload"** ‚Üí Opens file picker
- **Users can select images from their computer** ‚Üí Images converted to base64
- **Users can drag-drop image files** ‚Üí Automatically added to assets
- Images embedded as base64 in the HTML (no external dependencies)

### ‚úÖ Fix #2: Enable Component Interactivity

Created new method `enableComponentInteractivity()` that recursively processes all components and makes them interactive:

```typescript
private enableComponentInteractivity(): void {
  if (!this.editor) return;
  
  try {
    const wrapper = this.editor.getWrapper();
    if (!wrapper) return;
    
    // ‚úÖ Recursively make all components interactive
    const enableInteractivity = (component: any) => {
      if (!component) return;
      
      // Make component selectable, draggable, and editable
      component.set({
        selectable: true,
        hoverable: true,
        editable: true,
        draggable: true,
        droppable: true,
        copyable: true,
        removable: true,
        badgable: true,
        stylable: true,
        'style-signature': true,
      });
      
      // Process children recursively
      const children = component.components();
      if (children && children.length > 0) {
        children.forEach((child: any) => enableInteractivity(child));
      }
    };
    
    enableInteractivity(wrapper);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('‚ùå [enableComponentInteractivity] Failed:', error);
  }
}
```

**What This Does:**
- Called automatically after editor loads
- Called after loading saved progress
- Called after loading golden/ESP/AI templates
- Recursively walks through **all** components in the template
- Sets each component to be:
  - ‚úÖ Selectable (click to select)
  - ‚úÖ Hoverable (hover effects)
  - ‚úÖ Editable (double-click to edit text)
  - ‚úÖ Draggable (click and drag to move)
  - ‚úÖ Droppable (can drop other components into it)
  - ‚úÖ Copyable (can duplicate)
  - ‚úÖ Removable (can delete)
  - ‚úÖ Stylable (can modify styles)
