# Template Vanishing During Generation Fix ✅

## Problem
When clicking "Send" in the Generate Template page, the entire template preview would **disappear** and only reappear after the template finished generating. This created a poor UX where users couldn't see their previous template while waiting.

## Root Cause
The template preview component was being conditionally rendered with `*ngIf="!(isGenerating$ | async)"`:

```html
<!-- ❌ BEFORE: Component hidden during generation -->
<app-template-preview-panel
  *ngIf="!(isGenerating$ | async)"
  [loading]="false"
  ...>
</app-template-preview-panel>
```

This meant:
- ❌ When `isGenerating$` = true → Component **completely removed** from DOM
- ❌ Previous template disappears
- ❌ Poor user experience
- ❌ Unused loading state in the component

## Discovered Unused Feature
The `template-preview-panel` component **already had a built-in loading state** that was not being used:
- ✅ Has `@Input() loading = false`
- ✅ Has beautiful loading animation (neural network effect)
- ✅ Shows "Rendering Preview" message
- ✅ Keeps previous template visible behind loading overlay

## Solution
Instead of hiding the entire component, we now **use its built-in loading state**:

```html
<!-- ✅ AFTER: Component always visible, shows loading state -->
<app-template-preview-panel
  [html]="(currentHtml$ | async) || ''"
  [(templateName)]="templateName"
  [loading]="(isGenerating$ | async) ?? false"
  [showHeader]="true"
  [allowRefresh]="false"
  [allowFullscreen]="true"
  [allowViewModes]="true"
  [showGenerateActions]="true"
  [isGeneratePage]="true"
  (saveTemplate)="onSaveTemplate()"
  (runTests)="onRunTests()">
</app-template-preview-panel>
```

### Key Changes:
1. **Removed**: `*ngIf="!(isGenerating$ | async)"` - Component no longer hidden
2. **Changed**: `[loading]="false"` → `[loading]="(isGenerating$ | async) ?? false"`
3. **Removed**: Custom loading overlay div (was redundant)

## Benefits
✅ Previous template stays visible while generating new one
✅ Better UX - users see progress instead of blank screen
✅ Uses existing loading animation (no code duplication)
✅ Smoother transition between states
✅ No DOM thrashing (component not destroyed/recreated)

## How It Works Now

### First Message (New Conversation)
1. User types message and clicks Send
2. Template preview stays visible (shows placeholder if no template yet)
3. Loading overlay appears with "Rendering Preview" animation
4. New template appears smoothly
5. Loading overlay fades out

### Subsequent Messages
1. User types message and clicks Send
2. **Previous template stays visible** 👈 Key improvement!
3. Loading overlay appears over the previous template
4. Updated template replaces it
5. Loading overlay fades out

## Files Changed
- `frontend/src/app/app/features/generate/pages/generate-page/generate-page.component.html`

## Testing
1. ✅ Navigate to `/generate`
2. ✅ Send first message → Should show loading animation (no blank screen)
3. ✅ Wait for template generation → Template appears
4. ✅ Send second message → Previous template stays visible with loading overlay
5. ✅ Updated template appears smoothly
