# Link Matrix Validation Test Guide

## üìã Overview
This test data helps you verify the **Link Validation** feature in the QA Use Variant page.

The feature compares:
- **URLs from your source file** (CSV/Excel with "valid links" column)
- **URLs found in your HTML template**

And shows which links are:
- ‚úÖ **Valid** (in both file and HTML)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Missing from HTML** (in file but not in HTML)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Extra in HTML** (in HTML but not in file)

## üìù CSV Format Requirements

Your CSV must have a column header named exactly:
```
valid links
```
(Case-insensitive, so `Valid Links` or `VALID LINKS` also works)

Each row should contain one URL:
```csv
valid links
https://example.com/page1
https://example.com/page2
https://shop.example.com/product
```

### Excel Format
You can also use `.xlsx` or `.xls` files with the same structure:
- First row: column header `valid links`
- Following rows: one URL per row

---

## üêõ Common Issues

### "No 'valid links' column found"
- Check that your CSV has a column header exactly named `valid links`
- Make sure it's in the first row
- Case doesn't matter but spelling does

### Links not being detected
- URLs must start with `http://` or `https://`
- Invalid URLs are filtered out (mailto:, tel:, #, javascript:void(0))

### File upload not working
- Supported formats: `.csv`, `.xlsx`, `.xls`
- Check browser console for errors

---

## üí° Tips

1. **Export from Excel**: Save as CSV (UTF-8) for best compatibility
2. **URL Validation**: The system automatically filters out placeholder links like `#` and `javascript:void(0)`
3. **Screenshot Capture**: You can manually capture screenshots for ANY URL, even if it's not in the CSV
4. **Real-time Updates**: The validation updates automatically when you upload a new CSV or modify the HTML

---

## üìû Support

If you encounter issues with the link validation feature:
1. Check the browser console for error messages
2. Verify your CSV format matches the requirements
3. Ensure URLs are properly formatted with `http://` or `https://`
