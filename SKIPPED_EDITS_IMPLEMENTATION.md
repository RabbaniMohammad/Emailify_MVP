# ✅ Skipped Edits Implementation

## 📋 Overview
Added complete support for displaying skipped edits in both the verification summary stats and the failed edits modal.

## 🎯 What Was Added

### 1. **Skipped Stat Card** (Verification Summary)
- Added a new stat card showing count of skipped edits
- Only displays when `golden.stats?.skipped > 0`
- Uses purple gradient theme (#6366f1)
- Icon: Skip forward icon
- Fully responsive on all devices

**Location:** After the "Blocked" card in the stats grid

### 2. **Skipped Edits Section** (Modal)
- Added dedicated section in the "Could Not Apply" modal
- Shows below failed edits with visual separation (dashed border)
- Displays:
  - Section header with icon and count badge
  - Explanatory description
  - List of skipped edits with:
    - Find and Replace text (shows "(empty)" for empty values)
    - Reason why it was skipped
    - Purple-themed styling

**Location:** Below failed edits list in visual editor modal

### 3. **TypeScript Logic**
- Added `skippedEdits` property to store skipped edits
- Extracts skipped edits from `atomicResults` array
- Filters for `status === 'skipped'`
- Maps to simple format with find, replace, reason, status

**File:** `qa-page.component.ts` lines 165-170, 662-676

### 4. **Responsive Styles**
All elements are fully responsive across:
- ✅ Desktop (> 768px)
- ✅ Tablet (480px - 768px)
- ✅ Mobile Portrait (< 480px)
- ✅ Mobile Landscape

**Special mobile adaptations:**
- Stats grid auto-fits cards (2 columns on tablet, 1 column on mobile)
- Edit preview text wraps properly
- Arrow icons hidden on very small screens
- Font sizes reduced appropriately

## 📊 Data Flow

```
Backend Response
  └─> atomicResults (all results)
        ├─> status: 'applied'   → changes
        ├─> status: 'failed'    → failedEdits
        ├─> status: 'blocked'   → failedEdits
        └─> status: 'skipped'   → skippedEdits (NEW!)
```

## 🎨 Visual Design

### Stat Card
- **Color:** Purple gradient (#6366f1 to #8b5cf6)
- **Icon:** Skip next (forward arrow with circle)
- **Layout:** Same as other stat cards (icon + value + label)

### Modal Section
- **Border:** 2px dashed purple (#6366f1)
- **Background:** Light purple (#6366f1, 5% opacity)
- **Badge:** Solid purple gradient
- **Items:** White cards with purple borders

## ✅ Testing Checklist

- [x] No TypeScript errors

## 📱 Responsive Behavior

| Device | Stats Grid Layout | Modal Edit Preview |
|--------|------------------|-------------------|
| Desktop (>768px) | Auto-fit columns | Horizontal with arrow |
| Tablet (480-768px) | 2 columns | Horizontal with arrow |
| Mobile (<480px) | 1 column | Vertical (no arrow) |

## 🎯 Why Edits Are Skipped

The backend automatically skips edits when:
1. **Empty find or replace** - GPT provided no text
2. **Find equals replace** - No actual change
3. **Malformed data** - Missing required fields

These are **GPT hallucinations/errors**, not user errors, so they're shown separately from "Failed" edits which require manual fixes.

## 🔍 Example Output

**Verification Summary:**
```
[10 TOTAL] [0 APPLIED] [1 FAILED] [9 SKIPPED]
```

**Modal Display:**
```
Could Not Apply
  ❌ Failed Edits (1)
  [Shows failed edits with fix guidance]
  
  ⏭️ Auto-Skipped Edits (9)
  [Shows skipped edits with reasons]
```

## 🚀 Impact

- **Better transparency:** Users see all 10 edits accounted for
- **Less confusion:** Math adds up (total = applied + failed + blocked + skipped)
- **Clear distinction:** Failed edits need fixing, skipped edits are auto-filtered
- **Full responsiveness:** Works on all screen sizes and orientations
