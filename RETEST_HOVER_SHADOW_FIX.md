# Retest Button Hover Shadow Fix

## 🐛 Issue
After removing the Material button directive, the Retest button still showed an "egg-shaped" circular shadow when hovering.

## 🔍 Root Cause
There was a **duplicate CSS rule** for `.retest-btn` at line 1530 that we missed. This duplicate rule had:
- Old circular ripple effect (`border-radius: 50%`)
- Hover transform that moved the button up
- Conflicting styles that created the "egg" shadow

## ✅ Solution
Removed the duplicate `.retest-btn` style block entirely.

## 📝 Changes Made

### Removed Duplicate Block
**Location:** Line 1530-1562

**Code Removed:**
```scss
// IMPROVED RETEST BUTTON
.retest-btn {
  font-size: 0.75rem !important;
  padding: 0.375rem 0.75rem !important;
  border-radius: var(--radius-md) !important;
  transition: all var(--transition-normal) !important;
  position: relative !important;
  overflow: hidden !important;
  align-self: flex-start !important;
  flex-shrink: 0 !important;
  
  &::before {
    content: '';
    position: absolute;
    top: 50%;
    left: 50%;
    width: 0;
    height: 0;
    background: rgba(109, 40, 217, 0.1);
    border-radius: 50%;  // ❌ This was causing the circular shadow
    transition: all var(--transition-normal);
    transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
  }
  
  &:hover:not(:disabled) {
    transform: translateY(-1px);  // ❌ This was causing the movement
    
    &::before {
      width: 100%;
      height: 100%;
    }
  }
}
```

### Current Active Styles
The retest button now only uses the clean styles we defined earlier:
- Permanent purple border
- Square ripple effect on click
- No hover effects
- Color reversal on click

## 🎯 Why This Happened
The SCSS file had **multiple definitions** of `.retest-btn` scattered throughout the file. The duplicate at line 1530 was overriding our cleaner styles, causing the old circular hover effect to persist.

## ✨ Result
The Retest button now:
- ✅ Has **no hover shadow** or egg-shaped effect
- ✅ Has a permanent purple border
- ✅ Shows square ripple only when clicked
- ✅ No movement on hover
- ✅ Clean, professional appearance

## 📋 Active Style Blocks
After cleanup, `.retest-btn` is defined in only two places:
1. **Line ~660** - Main shared styles with `.clear-btn` and `.skip-btn`
2. **Line ~3505** - Additional loading state styles

Both work together to create the clean, modern button effect without any conflicting hover shadows! 🎯
