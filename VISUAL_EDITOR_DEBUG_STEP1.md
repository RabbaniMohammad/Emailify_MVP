# 🔍 Visual Editor Loading Debug - Step 1

## Current Status

✅ **QA Page loads correctly** - Template displays in original template view
❌ **Visual Editor not loading** - Need to debug why template isn't showing in editor

## Debug Enhancements Added

### 1. QA Page - `onEditOriginalTemplate()`
Added detailed logging to track:
- ✅ Template ID
- ✅ Template HTML length
- ✅ Loading state
- ✅ Whether original is in state
- ✅ What's being saved to state
- ✅ Preview of HTML content

**Console Output Will Show:**
```
📝 [qa-page] onEditOriginalTemplate() called
📝 [qa-page] templateId: abc123
📝 [qa-page] templateHtml length: 5234
📝 [qa-page] templateLoading: false
📝 [qa-page] Original template in state: NULL
📝 [qa-page] Saving current as original
📝 [qa-page] Current templateHtml preview: <style>...
✅ [qa-page] Navigating to visual editor with ID: abc123
```

---

### 2. Visual Editor - `loadGoldenHtml()`
Added comprehensive logging to track:
- ✅ When method is called
- ✅ What templateId is received
- ✅ What state service returns
- ✅ Content length
- ✅ Preview of content
- ✅ Final state of `originalGoldenHtml`

**Console Output Will Show:**
```
📥 [visual-editor] loadGoldenHtml() called for: abc123
📥 [visual-editor] About to call getTemplateForEditor...
✅ [TemplateState] Loading original template (temp_1)
📥 [visual-editor] getTemplateForEditor returned: CONTENT
📥 [visual-editor] Content length: 5234
📥 [visual-editor] First 200 chars: <style>body{...
✅ [visual-editor] Loaded template from state service
📥 [visual-editor] originalGoldenHtml is now: SET
📥 [visual-editor] originalGoldenHtml length: 5234
```

## Next Steps

### Please Test:
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Click "Run Tests" on a template
3. Wait for QA page to load
4. Click the "Edit" button (pencil icon)
5. **Share the console logs** you see

### What to Look For:

**In QA Page:**
- Does it show template length?
- Does it save to state?
- Does navigation happen?

**In Visual Editor:**
- Does `loadGoldenHtml()` get called?
- Does state service return content?
- What's the content length?
- Does `originalGoldenHtml` get set?

### Possible Issues We'll Identify:

1. **State not being saved**
   - Will see: `originalGoldenHtml is now: EMPTY`
   - Fix: Ensure `initializeOriginalTemplate()` works

2. **State saved but wrong key**
   - Will see: `getTemplateForEditor returned: NULL`
   - Fix: Check localStorage keys

3. **Content loaded but not displayed**
   - Will see: `originalGoldenHtml is now: SET`
   - Fix: Check `initGrapesJS()` loading logic

4. **Navigation issue**
   - Will see: QA logs but no editor logs
   - Fix: Route configuration
